### **Abstract**

This paper presents a novel hybrid energy system that combines micro-scale petrol combustion with solar-assisted ignition and thermoelectric recovery to generate electricity for electric vehicle (EV) charging. Designed as a modular array of 20 parallel units, each micro-generator combusts 0.2 ml of petrol per cycle within a hardened steel chamber, driving a carbon fiber–coated rotor. The system integrates solar-powered laser ignition, capacitor-based energy storage, thermoelectric converters, and flywheel smoothing to maximize efficiency and scalability. Compared to conventional petrol generators, this system demonstrates superior fuel efficiency, reduced emissions, and enhanced adaptability for off-grid EV charging.

**Keywords**: Micro-combustion, thermoelectric recovery, solar ignition, EV charging, modular energy systems, hybrid power generation

### **1. Introduction**

The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates innovative off-grid charging solutions, particularly in regions with limited grid access. Conventional petrol generators are widely used but suffer from low fuel efficiency and high emissions. This paper introduces a compact, modular energy system that leverages micro-combustion, solar ignition, and advanced energy recovery to deliver clean, scalable power for EVs.

### **2. System Architecture**

#### **2.1 Combustion Chamber**

Each unit combusts 0.2 ml of petrol in a sealed, hardened steel chamber. The combustion drives a rotor coated in carbon fiber, selected for its high strength-to-weight ratio and thermal resilience.

#### **2.2 Solar-Powered Laser Ignition**

Ignition is achieved via a laser diode powered by a dedicated solar panel (~5W), with energy stored in capacitors for pulsed delivery. This configuration eliminates reliance on battery-based ignition systems and ensures off-grid independence.

#### **2.3 Thermoelectric Recovery**

Thermoelectric converters reclaim approximately 10% of waste heat, converting it into additional electrical output. This enhances overall system efficiency and reduces thermal losses.

#### **2.4 Rotor Optimization**

Flywheel or magnetic coupling mechanisms are employed to smooth rotor motion, minimizing mechanical losses and improving generator stability.
