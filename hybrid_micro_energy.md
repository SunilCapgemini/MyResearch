# Hybrid Micro-Combustion Energy System for EV Charging: A Modular, Solar-Assisted Design

## Abstract

This paper presents a novel hybrid energy system that combines micro-scale petrol combustion with solar-assisted ignition and thermoelectric recovery to generate electricity for electric vehicle (EV) charging. Designed as a modular array of 20 parallel units, each micro-generator combusts 0.2 ml of petrol per cycle within a hardened steel chamber, driving a carbon fiber–coated rotor. The system integrates solar-powered laser ignition, capacitor-based energy storage, thermoelectric converters, and flywheel smoothing to maximize efficiency and scalability. Compared to conventional petrol generators, this system demonstrates superior fuel efficiency, reduced emissions, and enhanced adaptability for off-grid EV charging.

## 1. Introduction

The rise of electric vehicles demands innovative off-grid charging solutions, especially in regions with unreliable grid infrastructure. Traditional petrol generators are inefficient and environmentally taxing. This paper introduces a compact, modular energy system that leverages micro-combustion, solar ignition, and advanced energy recovery to deliver clean, scalable power for EVs.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Combustion Chamber

Each unit combusts 0.2 ml of petrol in a sealed, hardened steel chamber. The combustion drives a rotor coated in carbon fiber, chosen for its strength-to-weight ratio and thermal resilience.

### 2.2 Solar-Powered Laser Ignition

Ignition is achieved via a laser diode powered by a dedicated solar panel (~5W), with energy stored in capacitors for pulsed delivery. This eliminates reliance on battery-based ignition systems and ensures off-grid independence.

### 2.3 Thermoelectric Recovery

Thermoelectric converters reclaim ~10% of waste heat, converting it into additional electrical output. This boosts overall system efficiency and reduces thermal losses.

### 2.4 Rotor Optimization

Flywheel or magnetic coupling mechanisms smooth rotor motion, minimizing mechanical losses and enhancing generator stability.
