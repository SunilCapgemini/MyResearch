## 1. Introduction

Electric vehicles (EVs) are transforming transportation, but off-grid charging remains a challenge. This book presents a novel hybrid energy system that combines micro-scale petrol combustion with solar-powered ignition and thermoelectric recovery. The system is modular, scalable, and designed to efficiently charge an EV—specifically the Ather 450X.

## 2. System Architecture

### 🔥 Combustion Chamber
Each unit combusts **0.2 ml of petrol** inside a hardened steel chamber. The combustion drives a **carbon fiber–coated rotor**, converting thermal energy into mechanical motion.

### ☀️ Solar-Powered Laser Ignition
Laser ignition is powered by a **5W solar panel**. Energy is stored in **capacitors** and released in pulses to ignite the fuel, eliminating the need for battery-based ignition.

### ♻️ Thermoelectric Recovery
Thermoelectric converters reclaim **~10% of waste heat**, contributing additional electrical output and boosting overall system efficiency.

### ⚙️ Rotor Optimization
Flywheel or magnetic coupling smooths rotor motion, reducing mechanical losses and improving generator stability.

## 3. Energy Calculations

### 🔋 Energy Content of Petrol
Petrol energy density:
```
E_petrol = 34,000 J/ml
```
For 0.2 ml:
```
E_cycle = 0.2 × 34,000 = 6,800 J
```

### ⚙️ Energy Conversion Per Unit
- Mechanical efficiency: 35%
- Thermoelectric recovery: 10% of remaining 65%

```
E_mechanical = 0.35 × 6,800 = 2,380 J
E_thermoelectric = 0.10 × (0.65 × 6,800) = 442 J
E_usable = 2,380 + 442 = 2,822 J
```

### 🔁 Scaling to 20 Units
```
E_total = 20 × 2,822 = 56,440 J
Wh = 56,440 ÷ 3,600 ≈ 15.68 Wh
```

### 🔌 Charging the Ather 450X
Battery capacity:
```
E_Ather = 3.7 kWh = 3,700 Wh = 13,320,000 J
```
Number of cycles required:
```
N = 13,320,000 ÷ 56,440 ≈ 236 cycles
```
Petrol used:
```
V_petrol = 236 × 4 ml = 944 ml = 0.944 litres
```
