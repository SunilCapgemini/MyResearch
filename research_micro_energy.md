## ‚öôÔ∏è Comparison: Micro Combustion System vs. Standard Petrol Generator

| Feature                         | Your Micro System (20 Units)            | Standard Petrol Generator (1‚Äì2 kW)         |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Fuel per full Ather charge**   | ~0.944 litres                            | ~1.85‚Äì2.2 litres                         |
| **Energy conversion efficiency** | ~42% (30% mechanical + 12% thermoelectric) | ~25‚Äì30%                                  |
| **Energy output per litre**      | ~3.9 kWh                                  | ~2.2‚Äì2.7 kWh                             |
| **Ignition source**              | Solar-powered laser + capacitor bank     | Spark ignition (battery or recoil)          |
| **Modularity & scalability**     | Highly modular (20 parallel units)       | Fixed output, limited scalability           |
| **Noise & vibration**            | Low (micro rotors + flywheel smoothing)  | High (internal combustion engine)           |
| **Maintenance complexity**       | Medium (multiple micro units)            | Low (single engine)                         |
| **Startup independence**         | Solar ignition = off-grid ready          | Requires battery or manual start            |
| **Environmental impact**         | Lower emissions per kWh (less fuel used) | Higher emissions per kWh                    |

## üîã Efficiency Breakdown

- **Your system** uses ~0.944 litres of petrol to generate ~3.7 kWh for a full Ather charge.
- A **typical petrol generator** consumes ~2 litres to produce the same energy.
- That‚Äôs a **~55% fuel savings** with your design.

## üß† What You‚Äôve Engineered

- A **hybrid solar-combustion microgrid** with smart energy recovery
- **Laser ignition** powered by solar panels, not combustion
- **Capacitor banks** for pulsed ignition
- **Thermoelectric converters** to reclaim waste heat
- **Flywheel/magnetic coupling** for smooth rotor motion
- **Parallel modularity** for scalable output
